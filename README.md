# Word-Clock


Have your clock tell you the time in full written sentences by lighting up hidden words in a grid of random letters.
The face can also be easily swapped once complete to give it almost any style or look you like.
The Word Clock uses a Real Time Clock module to read the current time & toggle individual LEDs within an LED Matrix.
Each individual LED corresponds to specific written sentence.

Code updated to include:

1) Test NeoPixel Matrix on startup
2) Optional different color LED's for AM & PM display.
3) Optional minutes LEDs ('It is twenty minutes past five' rather than 'it is twenty past five' in the original code).
4) Optional o'clock LEDs ('It is ten o'clock' rather than 'it is ten' in the original code). This needs a bit of tape on the faceplate to convert the R to a '
5) Optional color change per minute to 'it is' between normal clock updates so you can determine the time to the nearest minute
6) DST code for UK/Europe
7) Optional (suggest temporary) button connections to adjust the RTC by +- 2 seconds
